#first the data for messages were loaded into a data set called message_data_raw, the notification label was split in order to have 
#separate columns for type, language and message number, column names changed to fit the style chosen for the survey data, and then 
#The types of message number column and message date column fixed to integer and date format. To see if user has participated in
#survey/experiment in both years Repeat user column is created by checking distinct years of messages sent


#To clean the data for use and joining with survey data, messages are filtered to those sent in 2023, and grouped by user ID.
#extra columns are created to check period of messaging, number of total messages sent and read, and finally the number of the repeated message.

#In the case of users that received a repeated message, all those that got their first message before the 5th of July 2023, had a repeat of the 
#message they received on 30th of June on the 2nd of July, a date on which an invite should have been sent but instead a nudging message was sent.
#However this shouldn't impact the results, as due to random distribution each type of messaging has 38 participants receiving a repeated message.
